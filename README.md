# CS 4641 - Machine Learning (Spring 2021)

## Group Project

* Contains code for K-Nearest Neighbors Classification model

* Compared accuracy, precision, recall, and F-beta scores for different values of K, the number of nearest neighbors used when fitting the model. 

* Optimization of k 
    * k = number of nearest neighbors used when training KNN model
    * Used 10 - fold cross validation
